2.3.4.1420
==========

New features:

  * Answered flags are now handled

  * Email priority are supported in conversations list & composer.

  * Flags are now re-sync at login time for your INBOX. This use
    usefull when you're not a minig-only user.

Technical changes:

  * login slow down. This is a consequence of flag resync.

2.2.18.1224
===========

New features:

Technical changes:

  * bug fixes


2.2.17.1206
===========

WARNING: index reset required for bug 924 fix

New features:

  * folders rename

  * no truncation when sender name is less than 20 characters

Technical changes:

  * bug fixes

  * Some big JS memory leaks were fixed. Still needs extensive
    testing.

  * Stability work to handle broken cyrus caches. Not yet perfect.

  * Fix cache corruption when someone copies a mail that is a parent
    of an existing mail.

  * Fix folder actions on non-top-level folders

  * minig_init_index.py does serial indexing

  * clean up of indexing code now that solrj provides an async
    indexing API.

2.2.15.1166
===========

New features:

  * "BaraFolder" : a compromise between GMail labels display & a
    tree. It features dynamic redisplay to show only folders with
    unread mails. Colors are automagically allocated to folders and
    are reused for search results. Thanks to an integrated search, you
    can locate every folder in a second.

  * Download / View links for attachments

  * Restore minig speed on conversation display.

  * Starred status should be correct in conversation reader.

  * Previous / Next buttons in conversation reader.

Technical changes:

  * imap searches & threading computation use "NOT DELETED" instead of
    "ALL". This should make MiniG more Thunderbird friendly when users
    forget to compact their folders.

  * NOT DELETED filter gives us a nice perceived speed improvement as
    we can (and now do) run "expunge" asynchronously when emails are
    moved.

2.2.14.1045
===========

New features:

  * Unread mails are auto-expanded in the conversation reader.

  * Thread grouping improvements. We now use cyrus THREAD extension to
    figure out what to group (RFC5256)

Technical changes:

  * When staying on inbox first page, data is transmitted only when a
    change is detected on backend. This saves 2KB every 20sec :-)

  * Use sax parsing for conversation lists calculations instead of
    loading the complete dom. Should be somewhat faster & suck far
    less memory.

2.2.14.995
==========

DEPENDENCY CHANGE: obm-solr >= 1.4-9 is required.

WARNING: A PostgreSQL database is needed to run minig. This will be
handled by debian packages once we are sure that switching to
PostgreSQL fixes bugs.

New features:

  * Big indexing speedup

Technical changes:

  * MiniG uses an external PostgreSQL instance instead of it's
    internal derby database.

  * A big file descriptor leak was fixed.


2.2.13.979
==========

DEPENDENCY CHANGE: obm-tomcat >= 2.2.13 & obm-solr >= 1.4-8 are required.

WARNING1 : This RC release requires a complete reset of the
webmail_cache (rm -fr /var/cache/minig/webmail_cache/* with
minig-backend stopped). If you don't reset the new thread grouping
feature will only apply to new emails.

WARNING2 : A Solr index reset is required:
   * /etc/init.d/obm-tomcat stop
   * rm -fr /var/solr/webmail/data/index
   * /etc/init.d/obm-tomcat start


New features:

  * Thread grouping should work correctly this time. The new code for
    grouping threads is faster than the previous one.

  * The "Show" link to display recent conversations with one of your
    contacts should work correctly.

  * Tartiflette mode : minig will now correctly detect when the
    session expires on the tomcat server (various possible reasons)
    and will inform the user.

Technical changes:

  * Some fixes to concurrent collections usage. A possible deadlock in
    backend session expiration code should be fixed.

  * Some performance fixes in the IMAP lib. Yourkit Profiler 8.0 +
    Sylvain's fat Junk folder is a pretty cool combination to find
    hotspots in the code.

  * Those releases are built with GWT trunk compiler as Google does
    not seem to care about 1.x. GWT trunk brings needed fixes to the
    RichTextArea component.

  * SOLR upgrade to 1.4 svn rev 817233

  * A script minig_init_index.py is available for initializing all the
    minig indexes after a migration.

2.2.12.932
==========

WARNING : This RC release might require a complete reset of the
webmail_cache (rm -fr /var/cache/minig/webmail_cache/* with
minig-backend stopped). If you don't reset the new thread grouping
feature will only apply to new emails.

New features:

  * This release promotes the rich text composer as the main and only
    one. You remain "netiquette" compliant as long as you don't click
    on rich formating.

  * Unread do not come first anymore : this was clearly a geek
    feature, important only when you never avec more than 25 unread
    mails in your inbox.

  * Real thread grouping. "By subject + ignore numbers" was creating
    real life problems (RIDA COPROJ 2009-XX-XX all grouped
    together). It solved the "tripwire crontab of the day" problem,
    but filters will be a better solution.

  * Identity pulled from LDAP will now use sn & givenName instead of
    displayName.

  * A menu is displayed in conversation reader on each message to
    provide individual actions. Only html printing & pdf export of a
    single message is enabled.

Technical changes:

  * RichText composer being the default one should break lots of
    things.

  * Multiple identy support is enabled in this release but having a
    signature for each identity does not work.

  * Do not crash when user has no mailAlias in ldap.

Known issues :

  * Mail composer breaks in GWT dev shell which is based on mozilla
    1.7.12. It works in chromium & ff3.5 so let's try it.

  * Mail composer defaults to an ugly font. Some GWT bugs prevent
    customisation of this font family/size.

  * FF3.5 loses cursor when replying to an email.

2.2.11.889
==========

WARNING: This release candidate disables the richtext composer. It
will be back soon, better than ever ;-)

New features :

  * Contacts are now shown "Lastname Fistname" and use a case
    insensitive sorting. This is used for LDAP _and_ OBM contacts.

  * <style> are correctly removed from received html emails and cannot
    break minig display anymore.

  * Links from received html emails will always open in a new window/tab.

  * All your LDAP mail attributes are available as an "identity"
    selectable in the composer. (To bad its useless on Toulouse
    install as our @linagora.com addresses are not in our LDAP
    directory)

  * When doing a search that returns results from more than one
    folder, small label showing the origin folders are displayed.

  * An "Unread" mails link is available below your Inbox link and
    provides an interesting view of your "to be processed"
    emails. This coupled with the small labels is a very nice way to
    watch incoming emails.

  * The "Back to XXX" link brings you back to last viewed page (at
    least the first time...)

  * Small style changes in the folder settings that should improve
    folder management usability on wide screens.

Technical changes :

  * fat derby page cache tuning. 256Mo out of 1024Mo minig pool should
    be dedicated to its internal database.

  * Indexes will be created in the derby cache automatically. This
    should speed up some operations touching lots of emails.

  * Cleaner debian package build process that creates minig debs
    completly from sources.


2.2.10.836
==========

(Previous official release was 2.2.7.743)

WARNING : This release requires a complete reset of the webmail_cache
(rm -fr /var/cache/minig/webmail_cache/* with minig-backend stopped).

This version requires obm-sync >= 2.2.10 to work properly.

New features:

(we are more or less on "bugfix only" policy for MiniG, so most
features are user visible bug fixes)

  * Drafts can now be saved when no recipient is specified

  * Undeletable conversations should no longer be possible

  * Completion now shows all mail addresses for ldap & obm contacts.
  
  * Email gathering should no longer generate duplicates in your obm
    addressbook.

  * Integrate OBM contact model using OBM-Sync Contact
    classes. Multiple emails, phones & addresses are now shown
    correctly in minig contact cards.

  * View my calendar on event invitations opens in a new tab


Technical changes:

  * You can now point you users https://obm/minig/WebmailUI.fr.html to
    ensure french locale if all your users have their obm lang set to
    french.

  * Improved IMAP & Sieve client lib threading & locking, to make them
    "o-push" ready.

  * SSO filter work. Should fix the "user is stuck on 403 error".

  * Fix UID cache corruption triggered but some old code that forced
    users INBOX to have id 1 (this worked when we add one derby db for
    each user).
  
  * Fix index corruption on unsubscribe / resubscribe to a folder.

2.2.7.743
=========

(Previous official release was 2.2.0.679)

WARNING : This release requires a complete reset of the webmail_cache
(rm -fr /var/cache/minig/webmail_cache/* with minig-backend stopped).

New features :

  * GMail style drag&drop with target folder highlighting.

  * Contacts view is now consistent with PDAs & Thunderbird : only one
    OBM addressbook with OBM rights & subscribtions applied.

  * Login speeedup (thanks to derby pool being share between all
    users)

  * Email addresses indexing improvement : austin.powers@minig.org is
    now indexed for "austin" "powers" "austin.powers" "minig" and
    "minig.org".

  * Sent folder now displays recipients instead of senders.

  * Deleting a folder moves it to Trash. Delete of trashed folder does
    a direct delete.

  * Address book queries will now dig up at most 250 contacts. A more
    precise query should be used to get the needed result.

  * LDAP filter now defaults to "cn" substrings and "mail" substrings.

  * SMTP errors should be correctly reported in the mail composer &
    prevent sending (attachment to big, unknown recipient, etc).

Technical changes :

  * All minig-backend to OBM database queries were removed and
    replaced by obm-sync requests. This change adds a strong
    dependency on obm-sync >= 2.2.7-1.

  * We use only one Derby database for all caches. This might be a
    temporary step before moving everything to a PostgreSQL (or MySQL)
    database (this is required because derby cannot process sql
    queries with more than 65535 tokens). The query that triggered the
    Derby bug was replaced.

  * New regenerateSieve.so API to trigger sieve script generation.

  * Default LDAP filter for addresses's completion will match "cn"
    substrings and "mail" subtrings.

  * Frontend session time was moved from 1min to 3min & backend session
    from 2 to 6min. This should prevent "john.doe" logins that occured
    when MiniG javascript (380Ko) took more than one minute to
    download on crappy networks.

  * Use multiple RCPT TO: instead of re-doing the SMTP dialog when a
    mail has multiple recipents.

  * New single sign on API allowing Lemon LDAP like sso systems.

  * Connections to the OBM database are not used in this version, but
    they are still created. 

  * /regenerateSieve.do API was added to force sieve script
    regeneration.
