Checkout
========

svn checkout http://minig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ minig-read-only

Repository structure
====================

the plugins & scripts directory holds the backend code.

webmail-frontend holds the various frontends

webmail-frontend/gwt holds a Google Web Toolkit based AJAX frontend
capable of using the backend.

The gwt backend is the only one, right now...

Build / Run scripts are provided.

# BACKEND        #
##################

Import in eclipse
=================

File > Import... > General / Existing projects into workspace > Next

"Select root directory" and browse to your "webmail/plugins" folder

Select all the fr.aliasource.webmail projects

DO NOT check "copy projects into workspace"

Finish

Creating an executable backend
==============================

To build the backend, use the product_build.sh script. This scripts
invokes an headless eclipse PDE build (i.e. you need eclipse 3.3.x
installed somewhere to build it).

Copy product_build.properties to <your
login>.product_build.properties.

Point <your login>.product_build.properties to your eclipse
installation :
 * the pdev variable is the version of the org.eclipse.pde.build
   plugin in your installation
 * the equiv variable is the version of the
   org.eclipse.equinox.launcher plugin in your installation

Run ./product_build.sh

The output should look like this (when run as user 'tom') :

 Loading ./tom.product_build.properties
 Found valid PDE & Equinox launcher.
 Setting up build dir & build conf...Done.
 Invoking PDE build...
 Build finished.
 PDE built package is 'minig-backend-svn-linux.gtk.x86.zip'
 Adding launch scripts to archive...Done.
 Product is in 'minig-backend-svn-linux.tar.bz2'
 Build finished.

At the end of the build, minig-backend-svn-linux.tar.bz2 contains a
runnable backend. The backend embeds equinox http server (Jetty), so
no further setup is needed.

NOTE to debian packagers : PDE build breaks in very strange
ways when running under fakeroot. To package it, use a previously
built backend.

Running
=======

After successfull build, the test_product_build.sh script will unpack the
backend & start it.

The output should be :

 equinox shell lib loading...[OK]
 webmail start...

# GWT Frontend  #
#################

the frontend has its own README file in webmail-frontend/gwt.

It is runnable in GWT shell for development purposes, or in tomcat for
production setups.

NOTE : A11Y is (and will remain) completely broken in this frontend.
