(The last version is now only in my Tomboy)

Frontend :
 - cache empty completion results in oracle

Proxy Client & Backend communication :

 - move messages

Backend :

CacheFile<T> to factor foldercache, summarycache & co.

 - conversation id allocator (unique accross folders) 
 - message.body should not be a string
 - delete conv (this is hard, as checkDirty does not detect deleted messages)

 - benchmarck full cache updates. Introduce uid cache & start by a faster uid only search.
 - Prepare cache updates on tmp files, to grab locks for minimal time

Plugins :
 - add ldap IBookSource to the ldap plugin
